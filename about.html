  <p>In December 2020, I'll be a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in English, focused on creative writing. I'll also receive a certificate in Digital Studies, which provided me with media production and web design skills. As an honor student, I've been submerged in several research opportunities and have expanded the breadth of my writing from historical research to travel writing. I've gained familiarity, through internships and within my certificate, with design tools and technical writing. <br /> <br />
    Although writing is my passion, I'm also interested in many other hobbies and inspirations. Such as...<br /> <br /></p>
  <ul>
    <li>rollerblading</li>
    <li>painting abstract art</li>
    <li>photography</li>
    <li>playing with my cat, 'sadie,' and my bird, 'pika'</li>
  </ul>
